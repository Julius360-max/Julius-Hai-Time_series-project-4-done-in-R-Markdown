# Julius-Hai-Time_series-project-4-done-in-R-Markdown

This repository contains my fourth project for Time Series Analysis** at **South Dakota State University**.  
It was completed in **R Markdown**, integrating statistical modeling, diagnostics, and forecasting evaluation using the **fpp3** framework.

## üìò Project Overview
This project extends prior assignments by applying advanced forecasting techniques, residual evaluation, and comparative model analysis.

### Key Sections
1. **Model Development**
   - ARIMA and ETS model construction  
   - Parameter estimation and model selection via AICc and BIC  

2. **Forecast Evaluation**
   - Out-of-sample forecasting and cross-validation  
   - Accuracy metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE  

3. **Residual Diagnostics**
   - Checking assumptions of independence and normality  
   - Visualizing residuals with `gg_tsresiduals()` and `ACF()`  

4. **Decomposition & Interpretation**
   - Breaking down trend and seasonality components  
   - Comparing model performance across datasets
